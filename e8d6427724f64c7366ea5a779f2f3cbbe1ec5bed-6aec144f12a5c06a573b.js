He graduated from York University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Specialist in Music. While at York University he not only continued his journey as a classical pianist but began his journey as an improviser, under the direction of educators Professor Casey Sokol and Matthew Brubeck.\n\nIn 2020 David graduated from the University of Toronto with a Master of Music in Piano Pedagogy and Performance under the instruction of Professor Midori Koga. There he learned the importance of listening and reacting, both when performing and when teaching. The difference between a novice pianist and a professional pianist in part is their ability to listen to the piano and change their touch accordingly; similarly, the difference between a good teacher and great teacher is their ability to listen and observe students and change their teaching approach to match each particular student.\n\nWhen teaching piano, it is essential to David that his students feel comfortable expressing themselves in the lesson. He believes that students learn best when they can comfortably share their thoughts, ask questions, participate in one-on-one discussions, and try new things; therefore, as a teacher, It is David's goal to actively ensure his students have these advantages. By identifying how each individual student learns best, how they are motivated, and what they appreciate most in music David customizes lessons to suit the needs, interests, and learning styles of each individual student. He sees each and every student as a unique case and works to develop a lesson plan that suits their particular needs.\n",louise:"\nB.Mus. in Performance, UVic; MMus in Piano Performance and Pedagogy, UofT; ACP in Historical Keyboard Performance, UofT; ACCM, Conservatory Canada (Associate Performer)\n\nLouise Hung's first introduction to Classical music was hearing a rendition of Für Elise playing through the speakers of garbage trucks in Taiwan as an awe-struck baby.
